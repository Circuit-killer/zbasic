# ZBasic

This is the beginning of a project designed to provide a very basic version
of a working ZipCPU system, that others can then build off of and design with.
It has three primary goals:
- To provide a usable beginning system to allow users to get *something* up and running quickly
- To provide a very basic system that can then be matched with an emulator, and used to test library and compiler functionality apart from actual hardware.
- To demonstrate the utility of [autofpga](https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga), and its ability to quickly, easily, and seemlessly add components to a design

# Status

The ZBasic system can now be made using [autofpga](https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga), all the way from zero to Hello World successfully in Verilator testing.
